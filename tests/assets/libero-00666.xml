        <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>
        <jats:p>Fossil hominins were first recognized in the Dinaledi Chamber in
          the Rising Star cave system in October 2013. During a relatively short
          excavation, our team recovered an extensive collection of 1550 hominin
          specimens, representing nearly every element of the skeleton multiple
          times (Figure 1), including many complete elements and morphologically
          informative fragments, some in articulation, as well as smaller
          fragments many of which could be refit into more complete elements.
          The collection is a morphologically homogeneous sample that can be
          attributed to no previously-known hominin species. Here we describe
          this new species, <jats:italic>Homo naledi</jats:italic>. We have not
          defined <jats:italic>H. naledi</jats:italic> narrowly based on a
          single jaw or skull because the entire body of material has informed
          our understanding of its biology.

            <jats:p>The figure includes approximately all of the material
              incorporated in this diagnosis, including the holotype specimen,
              paratypes and referred material. These make up 737 partial or
              complete anatomical elements, many of which consist of several
              refitted specimens. Specimens not identified to element, such as
              non-diagnostic long bone or cranial fragments, and a subset of
              fragile specimens are not shown here. The
              \xe2\x80\x98skeleton\xe2\x80\x99 layout in the center of the photo
              is a composite of elements that represent multiple individuals.
              This view is foreshortened; the table upon which the bones are
              arranged is 120-cm wide for scale.

          <jats:p>The word <jats:italic>naledi</jats:italic> means
            \xe2\x80\x98star\xe2\x80\x99 in the Sotho language and refers to the
            Dinaledi Chamber\'s location within the Rising Star cave system.

          <jats:title>Locality</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The Dinaledi chamber is located approximately 30 meters
            underground, within the Rising Star cave system at about
            26\xc2\xb01\xe2\x80\xb213\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2 S;
            27\xc2\xb042\xe2\x80\xb243\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2 E. The system
            lies within the Malmani dolomites, approximately 800 meters
            southwest of the well-known site of Swartkrans in the Cradle of
            Humankind World Heritage Site, Gauteng Province, South Africa.

          <jats:title>Horizon and associations</jats:title>
          <jats:p>The present sample of skeletal material from the Dinaledi
            Chamber was recovered during two field expeditions, in November 2013
            and March 2014.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>Six specimens from an ex situ context can be identified as
            bird bones, and few fragmentary rodent remains have been recovered
            within the excavation area. Neither of these faunal constituents can
            presently be associated with the hominin fossil collection (Dirks et
            al., 2015).
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>Aside from these limited faunal materials, the Dinaledi
            collection is entirely composed of hominin skeletal and dental
            remains. The collection so far comprises 1550 fossil hominin
            specimens, this number includes 1413 bone specimens and 137 isolated
            dental specimens; an additional 53 teeth are present in mandibular
            or maxillary bone specimens. Aside from the fragmentary rodent
            teeth, all dental crowns (n = 179) are hominin, recovered both from
            surface collection and excavation. Likewise, aside from the few bird
            elements, all morphologically informative bone specimens are clearly
            hominin. In all cases where elements are repeated in the sample,
            they are morphologically homogeneous, with variation consistent with
            body size and sex differences within a single population. These
            remains represent a minimum of 15 hominin individuals, as indicated
            by the repetition and presence of deciduous and adult dental
            elements.
          </jats:p>
          <jats:p>The geological age of the fossils is not yet known.
            Excavations have thus far recovered hominin material from Unit 2 and
            Unit 3 in the chamber (Dirks et al., 2015). Surface-collected
            hominin material from the present top of Unit 3, which includes
            material derived from both Unit 2 and Unit 3, represents a minority
            of the assemblage, and is morphologically indistinguishable from
            material excavated from in situ within Unit 3. In addition to
            general morphological homogeneity including cranial shape,
            distinctive morphological configurations of all the recovered first
            metacarpals, femora, molars, lower premolars and lower canines, are
            identical in both surface-collected and excavated specimens (see
            Figure 14 later in the text). These include traits not found in any
            other hominin species yet described. These considerations strongly
            indicate that this material represents a single species, and not a
            commingled assemblage.
